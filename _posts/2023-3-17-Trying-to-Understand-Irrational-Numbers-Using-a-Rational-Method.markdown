Most people enjoy playing Jenga. Picture yourself in a room filled with an infinite number of identical Jenga blocks, disregarding their depth.

<div align="center">
Jenga blocks
</div>
\
You become curious about the length-to-width ratio of a Jenga block but lack any measuring tools. Nevertheless, you devise a method to determine this ratio by arranging the blocks vertically and horizontally.

\
To find the length-to-width ratio, you count the number of vertical and horizontal blocks used once they align (vertical blocks / horizontal blocks).

$$\frac{\textrm{number of vertical blocks}}{\textrm{number of horizontal blocks}} = \frac{l}{w}$$

However, you observe that these Jenga blocks never truly align, only coming closer to alignment. You wonder what is unique about their length-to-width ratio.

**The answer is that the ratio is an irrational number.**

To represent an irrational number, you would need an infinite number of blocks, as it is impossible to represent such a number within a finite domain. The length-to-width ratio is a real value in your hand, yet it cannot be represented in a finite world. Irrational numbers like $\sqrt{2}$ and $\pi$ are merely symbols that indicate their existence.
